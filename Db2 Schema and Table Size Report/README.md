# Db2 Table and Schema Size Reporting
This Python notebook retrieves data from a Db2 database using a standard administrative table function and analyzes storage usage by table and schema. You can see the storage used by schema and even the largest tables in each schema.

# Using with DSX Desktop
An easy way to get started with Notebooks is to download the DSX Desktop from IBM: https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/desktop/welcome.html

Once you have installed the DSX desktop you can create a new notebook by selecting My Notebooks and New Notebook and From File. Download the MineRepository.ipynb file from this project and choose the file from in the Notebook File section of the Create Notebook form. Provide a new notebook and select Create Notebook.

You can then run the notebook by selecting the run cell icon for each step in the notebook. Make sure you update cell number three with your unique database connection information.
