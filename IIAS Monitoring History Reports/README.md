# Mine IIAS Historical Monitoring Data
These Python example notebooks retrieve data from the IIAS monitoring history and analyze system resource usage. You will need connection privileges to the IIAS database.

The File Storage Report graphs the usage of file system storage over time. The Network Report analyzes normal and peak transmit and receive volumes on the system.

# Using with DSX Desktop
An easy way to get started with Notebooks is to download the DSX Desktop from IBM: https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/desktop/welcome.html

Once you have installed the DSX desktop you can create a new notebook by selecting My Notebooks and New Notebook and From File. Download the MineRepository.ipynb file from this project and choose the file from in the Notebook File section of the Create Notebook form. Provide a new notebook and select Create Notebook.

You can then run the notebook by selecting the run cell icon for each step in the notebook. Make sure you update cell number three with your unique database connection information.
